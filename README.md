# Exploratory data analysis of titanic dataset

## Introduction
This report aims to realize an exploratory data analysis for extract meaningful insights
about the sinking of titanic. The dataset used was taken Kaggle and can be founded
in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Are titanic passengers young?
For better analyse the passengers age, an histogram was plotted.

The figure shows that the passenger data is skewed for the smaller values, having few
people with high ages. To get a better sense of the data, mean
was calculated in order to exclude outliers and have a view of the central trend of the data.

At last, the standard deviation was calculated.

![\Large std=14.4134932 ](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?std=14.4134932)

The fact that the standard deviation is half the average is yet another fact to support our hypothesis that most of the passengers on the titanic were young.
